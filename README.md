# gimpPlugin-animation to spritesheet


 aligns different layers of an image into one image.
 since gimp outputs the result of animations into several layers, it is sometimes useful to put all of these layers into 
 one image that can be used as a spritesheet, in game development for instance.

just a little gimp plugin i created to turn multiple layers into one image by juxtaposing every layer next to eachother.
